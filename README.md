<p>Just like the popular game Plants Vs. Zombies, palyer populate their colony with the bravest ants, that protect their queen from the evil bees that invade their territory. The game consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. </p>
<p>Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food or throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of the tunnel (Player lose), the bees destroy a QueenAnt if it exists (Player lose), or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (Player win).</p>
